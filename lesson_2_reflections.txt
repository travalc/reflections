What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: When you initialize a repository, you prepare the repository to be able
to receive commits. This is needed in order to begin the history of the
repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

A: The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository in
that it is a temporary place between the latter two where files go in preparation
to be committed to the repository. This is valuable as it allows the developer to
visualize the changes that they are committing before they happen.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

A: You can use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change
by adding only those files to the staging area that are relevant to the logical change
being made.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

A: Some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping my history organized
would be when I need to make multiple language versions or am experimenting with
a certain feature. Branches would help in that I would be able to do these things
while still maintaining a main branch that would represent what I would show off
to others.
