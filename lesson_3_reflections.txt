When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: You would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local
if you are contributing to a project that isn't yours.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: You would want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up to date with your remote repository because changes made on the remote repository
may not be wanted or needed on the project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

A: Forks are copies of repositories that are made on github servers, and are used when
wanting to copy someone else's repository onto your github profile while still giving
credit to the originator. Clones are copies of a repository that are copied either locally
or from the remote on github to the local computer. Branches represent a lineage of commits
or a version of a repository.
